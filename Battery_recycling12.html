    <h1>Battery Recycling: Challenges and Potential</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Recycling of battery materials offers a crucial opportunity to support the growing demand for materials while addressing environmental concerns. This process has limitations but remains vital in reducing reliance on primary materials. Below is a summary of key points from recent research on battery recycling.</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Point</th>
            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>The scientific evidence shows that recycling helps recover valuable materials, contributing to the <strong><em>closed-loop recycling</em></strong> (systematic reuse of materials, reducing the need for new ones) process, which supports a circular economy. üöó‚ôªÔ∏è</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>The scientific evidence shows that by recycling end-of-life batteries, we reduce the need for <strong><em>primary materials</em></strong> (raw materials sourced directly from nature) and alleviate the environmental impacts of <strong><em>mining</em></strong> (extracting raw materials from the earth) and <strong><em>refining processes</em></strong> (procedures to purify raw materials). üåç</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>The scientific evidence shows that despite its advantages, recycling can only cover a small fraction of material demand due to the challenges presented by <strong><em>battery chemistry</em></strong> (the chemical composition of batteries) and <strong><em>recycling methods</em></strong> (various processes used to recover materials from batteries). ‚ö°üîã</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Recycling presents great promise in reducing the need for new materials and minimizing environmental harm. However, its ability to meet growing demand is constrained by current technological and chemical limitations. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the full article.</p>
